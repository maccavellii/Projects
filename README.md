Projects
========

Coding projects I have done for different classes and/or fun.

These projects represent my own work and are intended to be avaiable for professionals as a resource to assess my ability in programming. I do not condone the use of any of this work for students taking classes at Case Western Reserve University. Use of these materials in any course at Case Western Reserve University violates academic integrity.
